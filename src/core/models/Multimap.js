/**
 * Defines a multimap structure.
 *
 * A multimap is a `Map` where each key can have multiple values. Internally, each key receives a bucket that
 * contains the values. This bucket is represented by a `Set`, which contains the list of values registered
 * under the key.
 *
 * When a value is set to a key, a bucket is created if needed, and the value is added to it.
 * Each further set to the same key will add values to the bucket.
 *
 * When a value is deleted from a key, the value is removed from the bucket bound to the key.
 * If the bucket is empty, the key is also removed.
 *
 * When a key is deleted, the bucket is deleted, removing all registered values as well.
 *
 * The iterators work as follow, considering a multimap such as `{ one: [1, 2], two:[3, 4] }`:
 * - `keys()` allows to loop over all the unique keys registered.
 *
 *   Say with the above example: `['one', 'two']`
 *
 * - `values()z allows to loop over all the values registered, one by one.
 *
 *   Say with the above example: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
 *
 * - `entries()` allows to loop over all the unique key/value pairs.
 *
 *   Say with the above example: `[['one', 1], ['one', 2], ['two', 3], ['two', 4]]`
 *
 * - Exporting a multimap to an array, like with `[...multimap]`, will produce an array of key/value pairs.
 *
 *   Say with the above example: `[['one', 1], ['one', 2], ['two', 3], ['two', 4]]`
 *
 * A multimap can be initialized from either an array or another instance. When an array is used, it must be an array
 * of key/value pairs. To assign multiple values to a key, the key can be duplicated in several pairs, for example:
 * `[['one', 1], ['one', 2], ['two', 3], ['two', 4]]`.
 *
 * The `get()` method will give direct access to the bucket used to store values.
